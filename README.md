# NF_MultiSpecies_Museomics_GLcalling

A fully reproducible pipeline for extimating genotype likelihoods and genetic diversity from NGS data. 

The pipeline is designed for museomic studies with both modern and museum NGS data and can 
be run on multiple species simultaneously. It is particularly well suited to low coverage 
whole genome sequencing data from museum samples, where SNP calls can be unreliable.
